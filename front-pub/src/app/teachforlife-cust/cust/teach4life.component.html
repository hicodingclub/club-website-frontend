                    HiCoding Club sees the difficulties everyone is facing and decided to take action. We organized the Teach4Life Program in order to support those in need of help. We are tutoring kids at an affordable price (10 dollars per session) to secure their educational
                    opportunities without placing much burden to their parents. All profits through this event will be used to purchase medical supplies and donate to local hospitals. We all hope this end quickly, and we can continue this event even after
                    the difficult time.
