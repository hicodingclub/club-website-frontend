                    In response to the ongoing pandemic that is greatly impacting the lives of many in multiple facets and canceling summer programs for students, we have decided to host an entirely FREE 3-week online summer camp (7/6 to 7/24). Participants will have the
                    opportunity to learn the whole process of developing a website and produce an elegant and functional personal website by the end of the program. A personal website is a great way to present oneself in detail to other people, and its
                    even useful when applying for colleges. Techniques that students will learn in this program include, but not limited to, UI and UX designing, photo editing, website development languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and a web development
                    framework (Angular). So join us now, and explore the world of web development and UI design! See more details on the "Program Details" tab.
